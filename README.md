Accelerometer and gyroscope are the two most common sensors that are used for terrain identification. Accelerometer and gyroscope data, for example, are represented by a set of three vectors acc[i] = (xi, yi, zi) and gyro[i] = (xi, yi, zi), where i = (1, 2, 3, . . . , n). We analyzed the data for different test subjects and found that the sampling rate for x is 40Hz and sampling rate for y is 10Hz. For every 0.1s of y there are 4 samples in the x. We extrapolated the label from y to correspond to 4 rows for sensor measurements. Therefore, each sensor measurement consisting of 6 data-points (x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2) along with its extrapolated label becomes our single data instance. We then form sequences of such data points as our training instances for the Bi-LSTM model. We experimented with several different lengths of sequences and configurations and chose the best one as our model to solve terrain identification problem. The advantage of using LSTMâ€™s for sequence classification is that they can learn from the raw time series data directly and thus do not require domain expertise to manually engineer input features.
